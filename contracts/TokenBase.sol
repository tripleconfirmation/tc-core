/**
 * @title TokenBase for deployment as the "Triple Confirmation" token.
 * @notice This token contract is ERC-20 and EIP-2612 compatible.
 * 
 * @notice
 * The size of this TokenBase contract allows for up to
 * 42,000 optimizsation runs. More runs than this doesn't
 * seem to produce a meaningful difference in the bytecode
 * size and thus likely doesn't help reduce gas costs.
 * The bytecode remains the same at 4.2 billion runs.
 * 
 * @notice
 * When the American spelling of a word may have a 'z'
 * in its suffix, we use 'zs' as a compromise with the
 * British 's' spelling. In other words:
 * "Optimization" + "Optimisation" = "Optimizsation".
 * Our project is based in the UK. Our Solidity devs are American.
 * We find the spelling compromise to be apropos.
 * 
 * @notice
 * Choosing which ERC or EIP standards to support is one of the most
 * research-intensive tasks to perform when writing a token contract.
 * We chose to start with the ubiquitous ERC-20 standard as our base
 * platform and ultimately chose to only augment it with EIP-2612.
 * 
 * @notice
 * We opted not to support ERC-223, ERC-777, EIP-1363, or EIP-3009 for
 * a variety of reasons. Most of all because none of those standards are
 * as widely accepted or expected as ERC-2ying 0 and EIP-2612.
 *   # ERC-223: We were unable to verify the extent of its support amongst
 *              popular DeFi platforms, and it's still in Draft as of 2023.
 *   # ERC-777: Implementation is quite complicated and its verification of
 *              functionality even more so. ERC-777 also has re-entry
 *              complications, most famously with Uniswap.
 *   # EIP-1363: We were unable to verify the extent of its support amongst
 *               popular DeFi platforms.
 *   # EIP-3009: Very similar to EIP-2612 but with the drawback of being
 *               unable to easily burn previously signed `permit()` messages.
 * Considering the adoption of EIP-2612 by Uniswap, USDC, ARB token, and
 * others, we feel the `permit()` gasless approval system is much simpler
 * while largely solving the long-standing concerns regarding `approve()`.
 * 
 * @notice
 * We chose to build on ERC-20 and EIP-2612 with optional automated
 * expiration of `allowance`s. Our automated expiration system is self-built
 * without relying or complying with any particular ERC or EIP standard.
 * Perhaps we will submit our system as an EIP in our attempt to further
 * improve the `approve()` + `transferFrom()` user experience while:
 *   # Complying to the expected ERC-20 standard
 *   # Providing greater security, and
 *   # Offering approachable controls over existing `approve()`s.
 * 
 * @dev
 * Variables are named without any prefix if the function is externally-facing
 * or with appended `_` prefix depending on how many layers deep. For example
 * the `__swapId()` function is itself nested inside the `_swapId()` function
 * but itself also has a nested function inside, thus there also exists
 * a named `___swapId()` function. The only exceptions to this rule are:
 *   # `i` for a counter omits the `_` prefix unless there's multiple counters,
 *   # and when the unprefixed variable name is already exists in global scope
 *     and would thus be shadowed. Example: `account` -> `_account`.
